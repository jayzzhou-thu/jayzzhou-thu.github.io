I am a third-year Master student from the [Deparment of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. I am supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).

My research interests include graph neural networks and their applications on text and knowledge graphs.
